The Odin Project 

The projects will be less and less explicit about how to achieve their goals, since we expect you to build on your previous knowledge. If you don't know how to do something, feel free to check back in previous lessons or projects or Google the correct way to implement it (though be careful, because that may take you deeper down the road than we intended). The Ruby on Rails Tutorial will be a good reference.

Up until now, we've been treating the "password" field of user submissions pretty cavalierly... it's mostly been an afterthought included for the sake of completeness. We certainly haven't been storing them properly or encrypting them, which we should. So wipe all that stuff from your memory because now you've got the tools to properly encrypt user passwords and we'll be doing it from now on. Actually, you've had the tools since back when you did chapter 6 of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial.

If you'd like to challenge yourself, don't even follow the steps below, just go ahead and build the app!
